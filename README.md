## Team Overview

Description of the communication protocols
- GitHub: keep the revision of the project straight and store the modifications in a central repository, so the team members can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.
- AWS: create AWS server to store massive raw data at the database
- PostgreSQL: connect to AWS server and give the access to the team member to the database, manage the data type, manipulate, pre-process the raw data
- Google Colaboratory: allow the team members to write and execute arbitrary python code, and perform data cleaning, machine learning, data analysis
- Tableau: visualize the data dimensions and analysis result, and connect with html to create a web for the output
- Zoom/Slack: Team meeting

Outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest) Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.
