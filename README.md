## Group 10 Final Project - Segment 2

## Project Overview

Content
The presentation outlines the project, including
the following:
✓ Selected topic
- Outlined in more detail in segment 1 above. 
- Our selected topic is to analyze and overview 2018 U.S. Domestic Flight data, specifically airports and airlines that suffer from delay.
- Use 2018 histroical data and machine learning to predict 2022 flights for specific airlines/airports and whether or not they are delayed and by how many minutes.
- No longer focusing on flight cancellations or earliness, focusing primalrly on arrival delay at destination and departure delay at origin.

✓ Reason for the selected topic 
- Using histroical data to predict future trends for travelers, this can help travelers, airlines and airports gain better insight on the flights that might be delayed given our machine learning features.
- Trevelers can get an idea if the flight they are on will be delayed or not, and if it will arive late at the destination airport, which can allow them to plan their travel more acccurately.

✓ Description of their source of data
- Outlined in Detail in Segment 1 above
- Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009 - 2018 from Kaggle.com
- Flight info. of US domestic flights for the all flights in 2018

✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data
- How impactful is weather on certain airlines?
- How impactful is weather on certain airports?
- How impactful is airline delay vs airport delay?
- Can we predict if a flight is delayed or not?
- Can we predict how much a flight will be dealyed?
- Is there a link between distance of the flight and the delay?
